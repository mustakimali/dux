## Analysis of Command Performance Using `time` Output

You provided performance data for two commands measured with the `time` tool:

- `dux -l`
- `du -sh`

Let's compare their speed and resource usage based on the output.

### **Summary Table**

| Command    | Real Time (total) | User Time | System Time | CPU % | Max Memory | Page Faults (disk/other) |
|------------|------------------|-----------|-------------|-------|------------|--------------------------|
| dux -l     | 0.390s           | 0.84s     | 4.37s       | 1335% | 6 KB       | 0 / 1336                 |
| du -sh     | 0.718s           | 0.10s     | 0.62s       | 99%   | 6 KB       | 1 / N/A                  |

## **Which Command Is Faster?**

- **dux -l** completed in **0.390 seconds** (real time).
- **du -sh** completed in **0.718 seconds** (real time).

**dux -l is faster by 0.328 seconds**.

---

## **How Much Faster?**

$$
\text{Time Difference} = 0.718\,\text{s} - 0.390\,\text{s} = 0.328\,\text{s}
$$

$$
\text{Percentage Faster} = \frac{0.328}{0.718} \times 100 \approx 45.7\%
$$

- **dux -l is approximately 45.7% faster than du -sh** for this workload.

---

## **Additional Observations**

- **CPU Usage**: `dux -l` used much more CPU (1335%) than `du -sh` (99%), which suggests `dux -l` is highly parallelized and takes advantage of multiple cores.
- **User/System Time**: `dux -l` spent more time in user and system space, but because it is parallelized, the wall-clock (real) time is lower.
- **Memory Usage**: Both commands used minimal memory (6 KB max).
- **Page Faults**: Both had negligible page faults from disk, indicating efficient file access.

---

## **Conclusion**

- **dux -l** is significantly faster than **du -sh** for this 40.43 GB directory, completing in about 0.39 seconds versus 0.72 seconds for **du -sh**â€”a **0.33 second** or **45.7%** improvement in speed.
- The speedup is primarily due to much higher CPU parallelism in `dux -l`, as indicated by the CPU usage percentage.
